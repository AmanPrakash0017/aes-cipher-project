# 🔐 AES Encryption & Decryption System (Java)

A **Java-based AES Encryption and Decryption Tool** that supports **CBC** and **GCM** modes for text and file encryption.  
It also includes **password-based encryption (PBKDF2)** for enhanced security.  

This project demonstrates how to use Java’s built-in **cryptographic APIs** to securely encrypt and decrypt data using the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** algorithm.
